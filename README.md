# Analysis of the gendered impact of COVID-19 in the UK 

In several European countries, radical political measures such as nation-wide lockdowns and other restrictions impacting the economy have been implemented following the covid-19 outbreak in Spring 2020.

Many of these political decisions and consequences of the pandemic impact women different then men. This project aims at painting a picture of the current situation to raise public attention and action to the subject.
